# User Rules

1.  **Preserve Code Integrity**: When modifying files to add features or fix bugs, be extremely careful NOT to accidentally delete or break existing functionality, imports, or logic. Always verify that existing code remains intact unless explicitly instructed to remove it.
2.  **Explain Before Implementation**: Always explain what you are going to do before you start implementing it. This ensures I can confirm you understood the request correctly.
